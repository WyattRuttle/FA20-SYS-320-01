2. Ensure you respond to why you selected the four other cmdlets and its usefulness during an investigation.
This is answered in the comments above each cmdlet

4. What did you find the most challenging about this assignment and what did you do to overcome it? 
The most challenging part of this assigment was to find other artifacts that would be useful in an incident response tool.
While there are plenty of artifacts, it was difficult to only use Powershell cmdlets. To overcome this I did a lot of reseach and found
a "Global Information Assurance Certification Paper" that referenced artifacts to look for during incident response. 
I then found cmdlets that could output information relative to what the paper referenced. 

5. What did you like the most about this assignment and why?
What I enjoyed most about this assignment was that it developed a thorough program. I like when the programs I make for class
are actually completed. By this I mean they are useful tools that I would actual use in production. This program creates .csv files
of artifacts and has the ability to email them in a zipped file with a checksum. This is great practice. I really enjoyed the fact 
that you made compression and security a part of the assignment.
